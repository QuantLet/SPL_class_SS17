Description: 'Performs four regression based methods to select appropriate variables in a machine lerning approach: Lasso regression, Ridge regression, stepwise backward selection and stepwise forward selection. Several graphs are produced: for Lasso, a plot of the crossvalidation procedure for the optimal choice of the hyperparameter lambda based on the mean squared error is plotted, as well as a trace plot. For the stepwise forward selection a graph displays AIC versus number of variables for the different models. A table that compares all models is exported in LaTex format. The fitted models are exported in RData format for further analysis.'

Keywords: Lasso, Ridge, regression, mean squared error, MSE, trace plot, AIC, crossvalidation
